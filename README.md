# Manual Testing Portfolio

Welcome to my manual testing portfolio. This repository showcases my understanding and experience with various types of manual testing. The tests provided here include sample test cases, test plans, and bug reports for different types of testing that I have worked on or practiced.

## Types of Testing

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components or functions in isolation.
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing the interaction between different components.
3. **System Testing**: Testing the complete system in an integrated environment.
4. **Acceptance Testing**: Verifying that the software meets business requirements.
5. **Regression Testing**: Ensuring that recent changes have not affected existing functionality.
6. **Smoke Testing**: Basic checks to see if the application is stable enough for further testing.
7. **Sanity Testing**: Quick checks to verify that new functionality works as expected.
